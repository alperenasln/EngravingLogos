# EngravingLogos
##Simple logo engraving by using 4 main directions and coordinate points
Main idea of the project is creating logo by "LOGO" ,"NAME" and "L","R","D","U" commands by giving input.
Then engraving it by giving input as "ENGRAVE","NAME" and "x,y" coordinates commands.
The expected output of it is printing all board.
"SAME" function is an extra point of the code and doesn't contribute or affect anything.
